A stag's  
skin's   
nictitant flit  

tries to unlatch a horsefly  
it has attracted, but how  
can mere earthquakes compete with bloodthirst's prod?  

Just imagine the way waves  
harangue the cliff's overhang  
and the cliff face spits salt:  

it is just the same way as  
deershide tidally shivers all along  
the flotsam ridges of its vertebrae.
